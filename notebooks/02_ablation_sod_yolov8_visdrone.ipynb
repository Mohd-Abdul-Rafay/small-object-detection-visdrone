    "#### Apply SAHI for Sliced Prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "This cell demonstrates and executes Slicing Aided Hyper Inference (SAHI) using the previously loaded detection model. SAHI is particularly effective for detecting small objects in large images by slicing the image into smaller, overlapping patches, performing inference on each patch, and then merging the detections back into the original image coordinates. This helps overcome the issue of small objects being missed or having low confidence scores when the entire image is downscaled for inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Section 4A: Run SAHI on a single example image**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **`sample_image = sorted(glob(str(VAL_IMAGES / \"*.jpg\")))[0]`**: This line selects the first JPEG image from the validation image directory to serve as a sample for a quick demonstration.\n",
    "-   **`res = get_sliced_prediction(...)`**: This is the core SAHI function. It takes the `sample_image` and the `detection_model` as input, along with several key slicing parameters:\n",
    "    -   **`slice_height=640`** and **`slice_width=640`**: Define the dimensions of the individual image slices. These are typically chosen to match the `imgsz` (input image size) used during model training to ensure optimal performance of the underlying object detector.\n",
    "    -   **`overlap_height_ratio=0.25`** and **`overlap_width_ratio=0.25`**: Specify the overlap between adjacent slices. An overlap of 20-30% (0.2-0.3) is common to prevent objects from being cut across slice boundaries in a way that makes them difficult to detect.\n",
    "-   **`res.export_visuals(...)`**: Saves an annotated image (with bounding boxes) of the SAHI prediction on the sample image to the specified `SAHI_OUT` directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Section 4B: Run SAHI on the entire VisDrone val set**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **`image_paths = sorted(glob(str(VAL_IMAGES / \"*.jpg\")))`**: Gathers all JPEG image paths from the validation set.\n",
    "-   **`for img_path in tqdm(image_paths):`**: Iterates through each image in the validation set, displaying a progress bar using `tqdm`.\n",
    "-   Inside the loop, `get_sliced_prediction` is called for each image with the same slicing parameters as the sample. The results are then saved as individual visualization files (e.g., `image_name_sahi.png`) in the `SAHI_OUT` directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "This entire process generates visual outputs for inspection, allowing you to see how SAHI improves detection, especially for smaller objects, compared to a direct, non-sliced inference."

    "This cell implements a custom evaluation loop to calculate the Mean Average Precision (mAP) at an Intersection over Union (IoU) threshold of 0.5 (mAP@0.5) for the SAHI-generated predictions on the VisDrone validation dataset. This is a common metric used to assess the performance of object detection models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a breakdown of the process:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **`iou_thr = 0.5`**: Sets the IoU threshold for considering a detection as a True Positive (TP). A predicted bounding box must have an IoU of at least 0.5 with a ground truth box to be counted as correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **`aps = []`, `per_class_stats = {}`**: Initializes lists and dictionaries to store the Average Precision (AP) for each class and other per-class statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **`for cls in CLASSES:`**: The core loop iterates through each defined object class.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   **`preds = all_preds[cls]`, `gts = all_gts[cls]`**: Retrieves all predictions and ground truth annotations for the current class.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   **`n_gt = len(gts)`**: Counts the total number of ground truth objects for the current class.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   **`preds = sorted(preds, key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)`**: Sorts the predictions in descending order of their confidence scores. This is crucial for building accurate Precision-Recall curves.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   **`gt_used = {}`**: A dictionary to keep track of which ground truth objects have already been matched by a prediction to avoid multiple detections for a single ground truth.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   **`tps = np.zeros(len(preds))`, `fps = np.zeros(len(preds))`**: Initializes arrays to store True Positives (TP) and False Positives (FP) for each prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   **`gt_by_img = {}`**: Organizes ground truth boxes by image ID for efficient lookup during matching.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   **`for i, (img_id, score, pbox) in enumerate(preds):`**: Iterates through each sorted prediction.\n",
    "        -   It finds the ground truth box in the same image that has the highest IoU with the current prediction.\n",
    "        -   If the `best_iou` is greater than or equal to `iou_thr` and the ground truth box hasn't been `gt_used` yet, the prediction is marked as a True Positive (`tp[i] = 1`). The matched ground truth is then marked as used.\n",
    "        -   Otherwise, the prediction is marked as a False Positive (`fps[i] = 1`).\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   **`tp_cum = np.cumsum(tps)`, `fp_cum = np.cumsum(fps)`**: Computes cumulative sums of True Positives and False Positives. These are used to calculate precision and recall at each prediction threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   **`recalls = tp_cum / (n_gt + 1e-7)`**, **`precisions = tp_cum / np.maximum(tp_cum + fp_cum, 1e-7)`**: Calculates the recall and precision values for the current class. A small epsilon (`1e-7`) is added to avoid division by zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   **`ap = compute_ap(recalls, precisions)`**: Calls the `compute_ap` helper function (defined in a previous cell) to calculate the Average Precision for the current class.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   **`aps.append(ap)`, `per_class_stats[cls] = {...}`**: Stores the calculated AP and other statistics (number of ground truths and predictions) for the current class.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **`mAP50 = float(np.mean(aps)) if aps else 0.0`**: Calculates the overall mAP@0.5 by averaging the AP values across all classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **`print(...)` statements**: Finally, the cell prints the overall SAHI mAP@0.5 and the individual AP@0.5 for each class, along with the counts of ground truth and predictions."

    "This cell provides a robust and multi-faceted approach to ensure that Weights & Biases (W&B) logging is completely disabled within the Colab environment. This is often necessary when W&B is integrated into libraries (like Ultralytics) or used in previous sessions, and you want to prevent any logging, save resources, or avoid conflicts.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **`os.environ[\"WANDB_DISABLED\"] = \"true\"`**:\n",
    "    -   Sets the environment variable `WANDB_DISABLED` to `\"true\"`. Many W&B integrations check this specific variable, and setting it usually prevents W&B from initializing.\n",
    "-   **`os.environ[\"WANDB_MODE\"] = \"disabled\"`**:\n",
    "    -   Sets the `WANDB_MODE` environment variable to `\"disabled\"`. This is another common way to instruct W&B to operate in a disabled state, often used by its SDK and integrations.\n",

    "-   **`from ultralytics.utils import SETTINGS`**\n",
    "-   **`SETTINGS.update({'wandb': False})`**:\n",
    "    -   Specifically targets the Ultralytics library's internal settings. Ultralytics (which includes YOLOv8) has its own configuration for W&B. This code explicitly tells Ultralytics to set its `wandb` setting to `False`, preventing it from attempting to initialize or log to W&B.\n",

    "-   **`try...except ImportError` block for `wandb` monkey-patching**:\n",
    "    -   This is an extra safety measure.\n",

    "    -   This ensures that even if some part of the code explicitly calls `wandb.init()` or `wandb.log()`, these calls will be effectively neutralized and will not perform any actual W&B operations.\n",

    "#### Define and Save YOLOv8-L with P2 Head Configuration (YAML)\n",
    "\n",
    "This cell defines a custom architecture for a YOLOv8-L model, specifically enhancing it for small object detection by incorporating a P2 feature map (higher resolution output) in its detection head. This configuration is then saved as a YAML file, which Ultralytics models can load directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **`BASE_DIR`, `SOD_RUN_DIR`, `P2_YAML_PATH`**: These lines set up path variables for the project directory and the specific location where the new YAML configuration file (`sod_yolov8l_p2.yaml`) will be saved.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **`p2_yaml = r\"\"\"...\"\"\"`**: This multi-line string contains the entire YAML configuration for the custom YOLOv8-L model. Key elements of this configuration include:\n",
    "    -   **`nc: 10`**: Specifies that the model is designed for 10 object classes (consistent with the VisDrone dataset).\n",
    "    -   **`backbone`**: Defines the convolutional layers that extract features from the input image. This part generally remains standard for YOLOv8-L.\n",
    "    -   **`neck`**: This is where the main architectural modification for small object detection occurs.\n",
    "        -   It implements a Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) structure with both top-down (upsampling) and bottom-up (downsampling) paths.\n",
    "        -   Crucially, an \"Extra P2 branch\" is added (layers 16, 17, 18). This branch processes higher-resolution feature maps (P2, which corresponds to a stride of 4, i.e., 1/4th the original image size). Including P2 helps the model detect very small objects that might be lost in lower-resolution feature maps (P3, P4, P5).\n",
    "    -   **`head`**: The detection head now takes `[-4, -3, -2, -1]` as input, indicating that it receives feature maps from P2, P3_out, P4_out, and P5_out. This multi-scale input from higher-resolution feature maps (especially P2) is vital for improving small object detection performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **`P2_YAML_PATH.write_text(p2_yaml)`**: This line writes the content of the `p2_yaml` string to the file specified by `P2_YAML_PATH` (e.g., `/content/drive/MyDrive/Projects/SOD YOLOv8/runs/SOD_yolov8_SAHI_training/sod_yolov8l_p2.yaml`). This makes the custom model architecture available for loading by Ultralytics."

    "This cell is a crucial intermediary step in the multi-stage training process for Small Object Detection (SOD). It prepares the YOLOv8 model for a specialized fine-tuning phase (Stage-3) by loading a custom architecture that incorporates a P2 detection head, and then initializes this new architecture with weights from a previously trained model (Stage-2 EMA).\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **`BASE_DIR`, `SOD_RUN_DIR`, `P2_YAML_PATH`, `STAGE2_WEIGHTS`**: These lines define `Path` objects to various important directories and files:\n",
    "    -   `BASE_DIR`: The root directory of the project.\n",
    "    -   `SOD_RUN_DIR`: The directory dedicated to storing results from SOD-specific training runs.\n",
    "    -   `P2_YAML_PATH`: Points to the custom YAML configuration file (`sod_yolov8l_p2.yaml`) created in the previous step, which defines the YOLOv8-L architecture with an added P2 feature map in its detection head.\n",
    "    -   `STAGE2_WEIGHTS`: Points to the `best.pt` weights obtained from Stage-2, where the YOLOv8-L model was fine-tuned with the Efficient Multi-scale Attention (EMA) module.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **`print(...)` statements**: These lines print the paths to the YAML configuration and the Stage-2 weights, confirming that the correct files are being referenced.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **`model_p2 = YOLO(str(P2_YAML_PATH))`**: This initializes a new `YOLO` model instance. Instead of loading pre-trained weights directly, it constructs the model based on the custom architecture defined in the `sod_yolov8l_p2.yaml` file. This is the 'Stage-3 P2 architecture'.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **`model_p2.info()`**: Prints a summary of this newly created P2 architecture, showing its layers, parameter count, and GFLOPs. This confirms that the P2 head is now part of the model structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **`model_p2.load(str(STAGE2_WEIGHTS))`**: This is the critical step for transferring knowledge. It loads the `best.pt` weights from the Stage-2 EMA-tuned model into the new `model_p2` architecture. Ultralytics' `load` method intelligently handles `partial-matching`, meaning it will load weights for all layers that have matching names and shapes between the loaded weights and the new architecture. New layers (like those specifically added for P2) will be initialized randomly, while existing common layers will retain their learned weights from Stage-2.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process effectively creates a YOLOv8-L model with a P2 detection head, initialized with the strong feature representations learned during the EMA fine-tuning, making it ready for further training focused on small object detection."

    "#### Fine-tuning YOLOv8-L with EMA and PIoU-style Loss (Stage 4)\n",
    "\n",
    "This cell initiates the fourth and final stage of fine-tuning for the YOLOv8-L model, building upon the EMA (Efficient Multi-scale Attention) enhancements from Stage 2. The primary objective of this stage is to further improve small object detection performance by integrating a custom PIoU-style box loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Path Setup (`BASE_DIR`, `DATA_YAML`, `SOD_RUN_DIR`, `STAGE2_WTS`)**:\n",
    "    -   These lines define `Path` objects for crucial directories and files, including the project's root, the dataset configuration, the results directory for SOD-specific training runs, and the best weights from the previous Stage 2 EMA fine-tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **`os.environ[\"WANDB_DISABLED\"] = \"true\"`**: This line explicitly disables Weights & Biases logging, similar to previous cells, to prevent interference or resource consumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **`PIoULossWrapper` Class Definition**:\n",
    "    -   This custom class is designed to wrap Ultralytics' default detection loss. Its core idea is to re-weight the bounding box regression loss (often called `box_loss`) based on an approximation of the Intersection over Union (IoU) of the predicted boxes. This is inspired by PIoU (Proportional IoU) loss functions, which give more importance to accurately predicted boxes (higher IoU) and less to poorly predicted ones (lower IoU).\n",
    "    -   `__init__`: Initializes with a `base_loss` (the original Ultralytics loss object) and two hyperparameters: `alpha` and `gamma`, which control the weighting function.\n",
    "    -   `__call__`: This method intercepts the loss calculation.\n",
    "        -   It first calls the `base_loss` to get the original total loss and its components (e.g., `box`, `cls`, `dfl` losses).\n",
    "        -   It then approximates the IoU based on the `box_loss` (smaller `box_loss` implies higher IoU).\n",
    "        -   A `weight` is computed using this approximate IoU and the `gamma` parameter.\n",
    "        -   The original `box_loss` is then re-weighted by this `weight` raised to the `alpha` power.\n",
    "        -   Finally, a `new_loss` is assembled by combining the re-weighted `box_loss` with the other loss components, effectively prioritizing better bounding box predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **`PIoUTrainer` Class Definition**:\n",
    "    -   This class inherits from Ultralytics' `DetectionTrainer`, allowing for customization of the training process.\n",
    "    -   `build_loss()`: This method overrides the default loss builder. It first uses the parent's `build_loss()` to get the standard Ultralytics loss object and then wraps it with our custom `PIoULossWrapper`.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Load Stage-2 EMA Model (`model = YOLO(str(STAGE2_WTS))`)**:\n",
    "    -   An `ultralytics.YOLO` model is initialized with the `best.pt` weights from the Stage 2 EMA fine-tuning. This ensures that the training begins with the already enhanced model.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Stage-4 Training with PIoU-style Loss (`results = model.train(...)`)**:\n",
    "    -   This executes the training process using the `PIoUTrainer` custom trainer.\n",
    "    -   Key parameters for training are similar to previous stages, but with a potentially lower initial learning rate (`lr0=0.005`) to fine-tune the model further.\n",
    "    -   The `project` and `name` parameters ensure that the results of this specific training run are saved in a dedicated directory (`sod_yolov8l_ema_piou_ft`) within `SOD_RUN_DIR`."

    "This cell performs a multi-faceted evaluation of the YOLOv8-L model, fine-tuned in Stage 4 (with EMA and PIoU-style loss), on the VisDrone validation dataset. It combines both standard Ultralytics validation and Slicing Aided Hyper Inference (SAHI) predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **`!pip install -q sahi`**: Ensures that the `sahi` library is installed in the environment for sliced inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Path Setup (`BASE_DIR`, `DATA_YAML`, `VAL_IMAGES`, `RUN_DIR`, `WEIGHTS`, `SAHI_OUT`)**:\n",
    "    -   These lines define `Path` objects to critical directories and files, including the project's root, dataset configuration, validation image path, the run directory for Stage 4 training, the `best.pt` weights from this stage, and the output directory for SAHI results. The `SAHI_OUT` directory is also created if it doesn't exist.\n",

    "-   **`val_results = model.val(...)`**: This is the standard Ultralytics validation method, which evaluates the model on the VisDrone validation set without SAHI. It computes various object detection metrics such as mAP@0.5, mAP@0.5-0.95, Precision, and Recall.\n",

This is intentional to collect almost all raw predictions, allowing for later filtering or custom metric calculation (like the custom mAP script in the next cell) across a range of thresholds without re-running inference.\n",
    "    -   **`device=...`**: Configures the model to run on the GPU or CPU.\n",

    "    -   **`sample_pred = get_sliced_prediction(...)`**: Performs SAHI on the first image in the validation set.\n",
    "    -   **`sample_pred.export_visuals(...)`**: Saves an annotated image (`sample_stage4.png`) to the `SAHI_OUT` directory, providing a quick visual check of SAHI's output.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Loop for Full Validation SAHI Predictions**:\n",
    "    -   **`for img_path in tqdm(image_paths):`**: Iterates through each image in the validation set, showing a progress bar.\n",
    "    -   **`result = get_sliced_prediction(...)`**: Executes SAHI on the current image with a `slice_height`, `slice_width`, and `overlap_ratio` of 640 and 0.25, respectively. These parameters are crucial for effectively detecting small objects by processing images in overlapping patches.\n",
    "    -   **`result.export_visuals(...)`**: Saves a visualization of the SAHI predictions for *each* image, storing them in the `SAHI_OUT` directory.\n",
    "    -   **Prediction Collection and JSON Export**: For each image, the bounding boxes, confidence scores, and class labels from the SAHI predictions are extracted and saved into a structured JSON file (e.g., `image_name_sahi.json`) within `SAHI_OUT`. These JSON files are intended to be used by a separate, custom mAP@0.5 evaluation script (like the one in the next cell) for a more detailed analysis of SAHI's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Final Print Statements**: Confirm that all SAHI visuals and JSON prediction files have been written and guide the user on how to proceed with the custom mAP@0.5 evaluation."

    "#### Stage-4 SAHI Evaluation: Custom mAP@0.5 Calculation\n",
    "\n",
    "This cell performs a custom Mean Average Precision at IoU=0.5 (mAP@0.5) evaluation for the Stage-4 model (EMA + PIoU-style loss) using predictions generated by SAHI. This custom script is necessary because the default `model.val()` in Ultralytics does not inherently process SAHI's sliced predictions in the same way, requiring manual matching of predictions to ground truths.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Path Setup (`BASE_DIR`, `VAL_IMG_DIR`, `VAL_LBL_DIR`, `SAHI_PRED_DIR`, `METRICS_OUT`)**:\n",
    "    -   Defines paths to the validation images, ground truth labels, the directory where SAHI predictions (JSON files) were saved in the previous step, and the output path for the calculated metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **`class_names`** and **`NUM_CLASSES`**: Define the class names and total number of classes for the VisDrone dataset, ensuring consistency in indexing.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Helper Functions**:\n",
    "    -   **`xywhn_to_xyxy(box, w, h)`**: Converts YOLO-normalized bounding box coordinates `[center_x, center_y, width, height]` to absolute pixel coordinates `[x1, y1, x2, y2]`. This is used for processing ground truth labels.\n",
    "    -   **`iou_xyxy(box1, box2)`**: Calculates the Intersection over Union (IoU) between two bounding boxes, both in `[x1, y1, x2, y2]` format. This is crucial for matching predictions to ground truth.\n",
    "    -   **`voc_ap(rec, prec)`**: Computes the Average Precision (AP) using the 11-point interpolation method, a standard for VOC challenges, given arrays of recall and precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **1) Load Ground Truth (GT)**:\n",
    "    -   **`gt_dict`**: A nested dictionary storing ground truth bounding boxes. For each class and image, it holds a list of boxes and a `detected` flag for each box (initially `False`) to track matches.\n",
    "    -   **`total_gt_per_class`**: An array to count the total number of ground truth objects for each class.\n",
    "    -   The script iterates through all validation images:\n",
    "        -   Reads the image to get its width and height (needed for denormalizing YOLO labels).\n",
    "        -   Loads the corresponding YOLO `.txt` label file.\n",
    "        -   Converts `xywhn` GT boxes to `xyxy` pixel coordinates and populates `gt_dict` and `total_gt_per_class`.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **2) Load SAHI Predictions**:\n",
    "    -   **`preds_all`**: A dictionary storing all SAHI predictions, organized by class ID. Each prediction is a tuple `(image_stem, score, [x1,y1,x2,y2])`.\n",
    "    -   It reads all `_sahi.json` files generated in the previous cell, which contain the raw SAHI predictions for each image, and organizes them into `preds_all`.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **3) Compute AP per Class**:\n",
    "    -   **`iou_thresh = 0.5`**: Sets the IoU threshold for considering a match between a predicted box and a ground truth box as a True Positive.\n",
    "    -   **`ap_per_class`**: An array to store the calculated AP for each class.\n",
    "    -   The script iterates through each class:\n",
    "        -   Sorts predictions for the current class by confidence score in descending order.\n",
    "        -   Initializes `tp` (True Positives) and `fp` (False Positives) arrays.\n",
    "        -   For each prediction, it attempts to find a matching ground truth object based on IoU. If a match is found and the ground truth hasn't been detected yet, it's marked as a TP; otherwise, it's an FP. Each GT can only be matched once.\n",
    "        -   Calculates cumulative TP and FP, then precision and recall curves.\n",
    "        -   Uses `voc_ap` to compute the Average Precision for the class.\n",
    "    -   **`mAP50`**: The Mean Average Precision at IoU=0.5, calculated as the average of `ap_per_class` over all classes with ground truth objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **4) Save & Print Metrics**:\n",
    "    -   Prints the overall `mAP50` and individual APs for each class, along with the counts of ground truth and predictions.\n",
    "    -   Saves all calculated metrics into a JSON file (`sahi_metrics_stage4_val.json`) for persistence and easy comparison."

    "#### Plotting Precision vs Confidence (All Models)\n",
    "\n",
    "This cell is designed to evaluate and visualize the **Precision versus Confidence** curves for various stages of the YOLOv8 object detection model on the VisDrone validation dataset. It helps in understanding how the precision of predictions changes as the confidence threshold is varied, providing insights into the quality of the model's classifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **`MODELS`**: A list of tuples, where each tuple contains a descriptive name for a model stage (e.g., \"Baseline YOLOv8-L\", \"Stage-2 EMA\") and the `Path` to its corresponding best weights file (`best.pt`). This allows for easy iteration through different models for comparative analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **`CLASS_NAMES`** and **`NUM_CLASSES`**: Define the class names and the total number of classes, ensuring consistency with the VisDrone dataset structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **`IOU_THRESH = 0.5`**: Sets the Intersection over Union (IoU) threshold used for determining if a predicted bounding box correctly matches a ground truth bounding box. Only predictions with an IoU of 0.5 or greater are considered True Positives.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **`CONF_GRID`**: An array of confidence thresholds (`0.05` to `0.95` in 19 steps) at which precision will be calculated. This forms the x-axis of the plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Helper Functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **`xywhn_to_xyxy(box, w, h)`**: Converts YOLO-normalized bounding box format `[center_x, center_y, width, height]` to absolute pixel coordinates `[x1, y1, x2, y2]`. This is used to standardize bounding box formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **`iou_xyxy(box1, box2)`**: Calculates the IoU between two bounding boxes, both in `[x1, y1, x2, y2]` format. Essential for matching predictions to ground truths.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **`build_gt_dict()`**: Loads all ground truth bounding boxes from the validation dataset. It stores them in a dictionary `gt[class_id][image_id]` and keeps track of which ground truth boxes have been `detected` (matched by a prediction) to prevent multiple matches for a single ground truth.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **`collect_predictions(model_path)`**: Loads a YOLO model from the specified `model_path` and runs inference on all validation images. It sets a very low `conf=0.001` to collect almost all predictions, allowing the `match_predictions_to_gt` function to filter by varying confidence thresholds. The `iou=0.7` here is for the model's internal Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) during prediction, not for evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **`match_predictions_to_gt(preds, gt_dict, iou_thresh=0.5)`**: Takes a list of raw predictions and the ground truth dictionary. It sorts all predictions by confidence score in descending order and then attempts to match each prediction to a ground truth box using the specified `iou_thresh`. It returns `scores` (confidence of predictions), `tp` (True Positives, 1 if matched, 0 otherwise), and `fp` (False Positives, 1 if not matched or already detected).\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **`precision_vs_conf(scores, tp, fp, conf_grid)`**: Calculates the micro-averaged precision at each confidence threshold specified in `CONF_GRID`. For a given threshold, it counts TP and FP among predictions above that threshold and computes precision `TP / (TP + FP)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Main Process:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Load Ground Truth**: The `build_gt_dict()` function is called once to load all ground truth data.\n",
    "2.  **Iterate Models**: The script loops through each model defined in the `MODELS` list.\n",
    "3.  **Collect Raw Predictions**: For each model, `collect_predictions()` is called to get all raw predictions (with a very low confidence threshold).\n",
    "4.  **Match Predictions**: `match_predictions_to_gt()` is used to determine True Positives and False Positives for the collected predictions against the ground truth.\n",
    "5.  **Compute Precision Curve**: `precision_vs_conf()` calculates the precision at various confidence thresholds for the current model.\n",
    "6.  **Store Curves**: The generated confidence and precision arrays are stored in the `curves` dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Plotting:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Finally, `matplotlib.pyplot` is used to plot the Precision vs. Confidence curve for each model. Each curve shows how the model's precision behaves as the confidence threshold changes, allowing for a visual comparison of the different model stages."

    "#### Plotting Recall vs Confidence (All Models)\n",
    "\n",
    "This cell evaluates and visualizes the **Recall versus Confidence** curves for various stages of the YOLOv8 object detection model on the VisDrone validation dataset. Recall is the ability of the model to find all relevant objects in an image. This plot helps in understanding how the model's ability to detect objects changes as the confidence threshold for predictions is adjusted.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **`MODELS`**: A list of tuples, each containing a descriptive name for a model stage (e.g., \"Baseline YOLOv8-L\", \"Stage-2 EMA\") and the `Path` to its corresponding best weights file (`best.pt`). This enables comparative analysis across different model stages.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **`CLASS_NAMES`** and **`NUM_CLASSES`**: Define the class names and the total number of classes, ensuring consistency with the VisDrone dataset structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **`IOU_THRESH = 0.5`**: Sets the Intersection over Union (IoU) threshold. A predicted bounding box must have an IoU of at least 0.5 with a ground truth bounding box to be considered a match.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **`CONF_GRID`**: An array of confidence thresholds (from 0.05 to 0.95 in 19 steps) at which recall will be calculated. This forms the x-axis of the plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **`DEVICE`**: Automatically detects if a CUDA-enabled GPU is available and sets the device to `0` (first GPU) or `cpu` accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Helper Functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **`xywhn_to_xyxy(box, w, h)`**: Converts YOLO-normalized bounding box format `[center_x, center_y, width, height]` to absolute pixel coordinates `[x1, y1, x2, y2]`. This is used to standardize bounding box formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **`iou_xyxy(box1, box2)`**: Calculates the IoU between two bounding boxes, both in `[x1, y1, x2, y2]` format. Essential for matching predictions to ground truths.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **`build_gt_dict()`**: Loads all ground truth bounding boxes from the validation dataset. It returns a dictionary `gt[class_id][image_id]` containing the bounding box coordinates and the total count of ground truth objects across all classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **`run_inference_collect_preds(model, img_files)`**: Loads a YOLO model and runs inference on all validation images with a very low `conf=0.001` to collect almost all predictions. This allows the `match_predictions_to_gt` function to filter by varying confidence thresholds later. It returns a list of predictions `(cls, image_id, score, [x1,y1,x2,y2])`.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **`match_predictions_to_gt(preds, gt_dict, iou_thresh=0.5)`**: Takes a list of raw predictions and the ground truth dictionary. It sorts all predictions by confidence score in descending order and then attempts to match each prediction to a ground truth box using the specified `iou_thresh`. It returns `scores` (confidence of predictions), `tp` (True Positives, 1 if matched, 0 otherwise), and `fp` (False Positives, 1 if not matched or already detected).\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **`recall_vs_conf(scores, tp, total_gt, conf_grid)`**: Calculates the micro-averaged recall at each confidence threshold specified in `CONF_GRID`. For a given threshold, it counts TP among predictions above that threshold and computes recall `TP / total_gt`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Main Process:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Load Ground Truth**: The `build_gt_dict()` function is called once to load all ground truth data and the total number of ground truth objects.\n",
    "2.  **Iterate Models**: The script loops through each model defined in the `MODELS` list.\n",
    "3.  **Run Inference and Collect Raw Predictions**: For each model, `run_inference_collect_preds()` is called to obtain all raw predictions.\n",
    "4.  **Match Predictions**: `match_predictions_to_gt()` is used to determine True Positives and False Positives for the collected predictions against the ground truth.\n",
    "5.  **Compute Recall Curve**: `recall_vs_conf()` calculates the recall at various confidence thresholds for the current model.\n",
    "6.  **Store Curves**: The generated confidence and recall arrays are stored in the `curves_recall` dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Plotting:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Finally, `matplotlib.pyplot` is used to plot the Recall vs. Confidence curve for each model. Each curve shows how the model's recall behaves as the confidence threshold changes, allowing for a visual comparison of the different model stages."

    "#### Plotting F1 vs Confidence (All Models)\n",
    "\n",
    "This cell evaluates and visualizes the **F1 score versus Confidence** curves for various stages of the YOLOv8 object detection model on the VisDrone validation dataset. The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a single metric that balances both. This plot helps in understanding how the model's overall detection performance (balancing both false positives and false negatives) changes as the confidence threshold for predictions is adjusted.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **`MODELS`**: A list of tuples, each containing a descriptive name for a model stage (e.g., \"Baseline YOLOv8-L\", \"Stage-2 EMA\") and the `Path` to its corresponding best weights file (`best.pt`). This enables comparative analysis across different model stages.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **`CLASS_NAMES`** and **`NUM_CLASSES`**: Define the class names and the total number of classes, ensuring consistency with the VisDrone dataset structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **`IOU_THRESH = 0.5`**: Sets the Intersection over Union (IoU) threshold. A predicted bounding box must have an IoU of at least 0.5 with a ground truth bounding box to be considered a match.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **`CONF_GRID`**: An array of confidence thresholds (from 0.05 to 0.95 in 19 steps) at which F1 score will be calculated. This forms the x-axis of the plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **`DEVICE`**: Automatically detects if a CUDA-enabled GPU is available and sets the device to `0` (first GPU) or `cpu` accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Helper Functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **`xywhn_to_xyxy(box, w, h)`**: Converts YOLO-normalized bounding box format `[center_x, center_y, width, height]` to absolute pixel coordinates `[x1, y1, x2, y2]`. This is used to standardize bounding box formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **`iou_xyxy(box1, box2)`**: Calculates the IoU between two bounding boxes, both in `[x1, y1, x2, y2]` format. Essential for matching predictions to ground truths.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **`build_gt_dict()`**: Loads all ground truth bounding boxes from the validation dataset. It returns a dictionary `gt[class_id][image_id]` containing the bounding box coordinates and the total count of ground truth objects across all classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **`run_inference_collect_preds(model, img_files)`**: Loads a YOLO model and runs inference on all validation images with a very low `conf=0.001` to collect almost all predictions. This allows the `match_predictions_to_gt` function to filter by varying confidence thresholds later. It returns a list of predictions `(cls, image_id, score, [x1,y1,x2,y2])`.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **`match_predictions_to_gt(preds, gt_dict, iou_thresh=0.5)`**: Takes a list of raw predictions and the ground truth dictionary. It sorts all predictions by confidence score in descending order and then attempts to match each prediction to a ground truth box using the specified `iou_thresh`. It returns `scores` (confidence of predictions), `tp` (True Positives, 1 if matched, 0 otherwise), and `fp` (False Positives, 1 if not matched or already detected).\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **`f1_vs_conf(scores, tp, fp, total_gt, conf_grid)`**: Calculates the micro-averaged F1 score at each confidence threshold specified in `CONF_GRID`. For a given threshold, it computes precision and recall from `tp`, `fp`, and `total_gt` among predictions above that threshold, and then calculates F1 score.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Main Process:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Load Ground Truth**: The `build_gt_dict()` function is called once to load all ground truth data and the total number of ground truth objects.\n",
    "2.  **Iterate Models**: The script loops through each model defined in the `MODELS` list.\n",
    "3.  **Run Inference and Collect Raw Predictions**: For each model, `run_inference_collect_preds()` is called to obtain all raw predictions.\n",
    "4.  **Match Predictions**: `match_predictions_to_gt()` is used to determine True Positives and False Positives for the collected predictions against the ground truth.\n",
    "5.  **Compute F1 Curve**: `f1_vs_conf()` calculates the F1 score at various confidence thresholds for the current model.\n",
    "6.  **Store Curves**: The generated confidence and F1 score arrays are stored in the `curves_f1` dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Plotting:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Finally, `matplotlib.pyplot` is used to plot the F1 vs. Confidence curve for each model. Each curve shows how the model's F1 score behaves as the confidence threshold changes, allowing for a visual comparison of the different model stages."

    "#### Plotting Precision vs Recall (All Models)\n",
    "\n",
    "This cell evaluates and visualizes the **Precision versus Recall** curves for various stages of the YOLOv8 object detection model on the VisDrone validation dataset. A Precision-Recall (PR) curve illustrates the trade-off between precision (the proportion of correct positive identifications) and recall (the proportion of actual positives correctly identified) at various confidence thresholds. A higher area under the PR curve generally indicates a better performing model.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **`MODELS`**: A list of tuples, each containing a descriptive name for a model stage (e.g., \"Baseline YOLOv8-L\", \"Stage-2 EMA\") and the `Path` to its corresponding best weights file (`best.pt`). This enables comparative analysis across different model stages.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **`CLASS_NAMES`** and **`NUM_CLASSES`**: Define the class names and the total number of classes, ensuring consistency with the VisDrone dataset structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **`IOU_THRESH = 0.5`**: Sets the Intersection over Union (IoU) threshold. A predicted bounding box must have an IoU of at least 0.5 with a ground truth bounding box to be considered a match.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **`DEVICE`**: Automatically detects if a CUDA-enabled GPU is available and sets the device to `0` (first GPU) or `cpu` accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Helper Functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **`xywhn_to_xyxy(box, w, h)`**: Converts YOLO-normalized bounding box format `[center_x, center_y, width, height]` to absolute pixel coordinates `[x1, y1, x2, y2]`. This is used to standardize bounding box formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **`iou_xyxy(box1, box2)`**: Calculates the IoU between two bounding boxes, both in `[x1, y1, x2, y2]` format. Essential for matching predictions to ground truths.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **`build_gt_dict()`**: Loads all ground truth bounding boxes from the validation dataset. It returns a dictionary `gt[class_id][image_id]` containing the bounding box coordinates and the total count of ground truth objects across all classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **`run_inference_collect_preds(model, img_files)`**: Loads a YOLO model and runs inference on all validation images with a very low `conf=0.001` to collect almost all predictions. This allows the `match_predictions_to_gt` function to filter by varying confidence thresholds later. It returns a list of predictions `(cls, image_id, score, [x1,y1,x2,y2])`.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **`match_predictions_to_gt(preds, gt_dict, iou_thresh=0.5)`**: Takes a list of raw predictions and the ground truth dictionary. It sorts all predictions by confidence score in descending order and then attempts to match each prediction to a ground truth box using the specified `iou_thresh`. It returns `scores` (confidence of predictions), `tp` (True Positives, 1 if matched, 0 otherwise), and `fp` (False Positives, 1 if not matched or already detected).\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **`precision_recall_curve(scores, tp, fp, total_gt)`**: Calculates the micro-averaged precision and recall values at different confidence thresholds to construct the PR curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Main Process:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Load Ground Truth**: The `build_gt_dict()` function is called once to load all ground truth data and the total number of ground truth objects.\n",
    "2.  **Iterate Models**: The script loops through each model defined in the `MODELS` list.\n",
    "3.  **Run Inference and Collect Raw Predictions**: For each model, `run_inference_collect_preds()` is called to obtain all raw predictions.\n",
    "4.  **Match Predictions**: `match_predictions_to_gt()` is used to determine True Positives and False Positives for the collected predictions against the ground truth.\n",
    "5.  **Compute PR Curve**: `precision_recall_curve()` calculates the precision and recall values for the current model.\n",
    "6.  **Store Curves**: The generated recall and precision arrays are stored in the `pr_curves` dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Plotting:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Finally, `matplotlib.pyplot` is used to plot the Precision vs. Recall curve for each model. Each curve represents the trade-off between precision and recall, allowing for a visual comparison of the different model stages. Points are optionally subsampled to reduce clutter for curves with many points."
